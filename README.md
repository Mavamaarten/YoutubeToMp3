YoutubeToMp3
============
My first github repo! Woohoo!
Anyways. This is a YouTube to mp3 converter I wrote. Excuse me for the horrible names for my classes, I seriously could not think of anything better.
Not all exceptions are properly handled as of right now, I might do that in the future. My main focus was, as always, the UI.

#Todo
- Let the user select a format and bitrate (right now it just picks the highest quality available)
- Handle exceptions (When you do weird stuff, it might fuck up)
- Let the user select a directory to save the file in
- Clean up the mp4 afterwards
